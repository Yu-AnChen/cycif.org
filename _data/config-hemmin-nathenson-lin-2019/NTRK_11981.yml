      Description: The specimen is stained with a panel of markers comprising of cell
        type markers (keratin, CDX2, CD45 and aSMA) and protein stress markers (HSF1,
        Hsp27, Hsp70 and Hsp90).

      Description: 'The normal epithelium is recognizable by

        the distinct tissue morphology with

        organized structures staining positive

        for keratin and alpha smooth muscle

        actin (SMA).


        The cells in the intestinal villi

        express both keratin (blue) and CDX2 (red). The villi

        are surrounded by stromal cells (green) and

        immune cells (white) that at times

        infiltrate the inner villus structure.
