      Description: The specimen is stained with a panel of markers comprising of cell type markers (keratin, CDX2, CD45 and aSMA) and protein stress markers (HSF1, Hsp27, Hsp70 and Hsp90).

    - Name: Normal Epithelium
      Group: Cell Type
      Description: |
        The normal epithelium is recognizable by
        the distinct tissue morphology with
        organized structures staining positive
        for keratin and alpha smooth muscle
        actin (SMA).
        
        The cells in the intestinal villi
        express both keratin (blue) and CDX2 (red). The villi
        are surrounded by stromal cells (green) and
        immune cells (white) that at times
        infiltrate the inner villus structure.

    - Name: Tumor tissue
      Group: Cell Type
      Description: |
        The tumor tissue is characterized by
        high levels of `CDX2` expression.

      Group: HSF1 Foci
      Description: |
        `HSF1` is also enriched in the tumor
        tissue.

    - Name: HSF1 in foci
      Group: HSF1 Foci
      Description: |
        In spatially distinct part of the tumor
        tissue HSF1 is found in nuclear
        condensates. These `HSF1` foci are often
        referred to as nuclear stress granules. 

        The granules are thought to be a sign of
        cells undergoing protein stress.

    - Name: Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperones
      Group: Chaperones
      Description: |
        The `Hsp70` (green) and `Hsp90` (red)
        chaperones are fundamental for
        maintaining cellular protein
        homeostasis. `HSF1`  is one of the
        transcription factors regulating the
        expression of these key chaperone
        proteins.

        HSF1 foci are not correlated with
        chaperone protein expression.
      Group: Chaperones
      Description: |
        Surprisingly the presence of `HSF1` foci
        is not positively  correlated with
        higher expression of chaperone proteins.

        In some instances in fact the presence
        of HSF1 foci are strongly
        anti-correlated with chaperone proteins.
