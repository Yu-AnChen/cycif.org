      Description: |
        This coronary artery shows atherosclerosis with approximately 
        75% occlusion, which is the level seen in patients who experience 
        chest pain on exertion (exertional angina). Unstable plaques tend 
        to have a more significant atheromatous component.
        
        Plaques with atheromatous changes are termed vulnerable plaques. 
        These are unstable and prone to undergoing plaque erosion, thrombosis, 
        and massive myocardial infarction. 
        
        The term atherosclerosis originates from the Greek work athero 
        which means gruel and sclerosis which means hard.

        The tunica media is of variable thickness with some areas showing 
        marked thinning and atrophy due to pressure. 
        
        The tunica adventitia of the coronary arteries contain small clusters of 
        inflammatory cells as well as capillaries and adipose tissue.

    - Name: Calcification
      Group: H&E
      Description: |
        There is extensive fibrosis and calcification which suggests a stable lesion 
        that is not prone to undergoing erosion, rupture, and ultimately thrombosis.

        Coronary arteries must undergo special treatment that permits them to be 
        sectioned and mounted on a slide. This treatment (decalcification) removes 
        much of the calcium that builds up in the vessel walls which would prevent 
        the microtome blades from cutting. The remaining calcium can be seen as a 
        bluish material.
