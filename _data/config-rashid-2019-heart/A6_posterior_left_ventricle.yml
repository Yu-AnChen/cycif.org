      Description: |
        In this low magnification view, there is an acute myocardial infarction with 
        neutrophils in the interstitial space next to a remote infarct with dense 
        collagen deposition.

    - Name: Stunned Myocardium
      Group: H&E
      Description: |
        Between areas of acute infarction and remote infarct and the endocardial lining 
        is a zone of viable myocytes that is approximately five myocytes in thickness. 
        
        These cells have the vacuolization that is characteristic of stunned myocardium. 
        Such features result when the myocytes are unable to maintain ionic homeostasis 
        and there is water accumulation in the intracellular compartment. 
        
        These myocytes can become isolated from the contractile apparatus and can 
        become the substrate for tachyarrhythmias.

    - Name: Wavy Fibers
      Group: H&E
      Description: |
        This is high magnification view of a region of acutely ischemic myocytes termed 
        wavy fibers (approximately 6-12 hours). The force of contracting neighboring 
        fibers cause the non-contractile fibers to stretch and fold, ultimately forming 
        the wavy pattern.
