      Description: |
        The mid-distal right coronary artery shows severe atherosclerosis with 90% occlusion.

        Coronary arteries must undergo special treatment that permits them 
        to be sectioned and mounted on a slide. This treatment (decalcification) 
        removes much of the calcium that builds up in the vessel walls which 
        would prevent the microtome blades from cutting. The remaining calcium 
        can be seen as a bluish material. 
        
        The adventitia of the coronary arteries contain small clusters of 
        inflammatory cells as well as capillaries and adipose tissue.
        
        The tunica media is of variable thickness with some areas showing 
        marked thinning and atrophy due to pressure. There is extensive fibrosis 
        and calcification which suggests a stable lesion that is not prone 
        to undergoing erosion and rupture and ultimately thrombosis. 
        
        Unstable plaques tend to have a more significant atheromatous component. 
        
        In tissue sections, atheromatous areas are seen as cleared out spaced. 
        This clearing results from tissue processing methods that gradually 
        dehydrate tissues through ascending strengths of alcohol, followed 
        by immersion in the organic solvent xylene which removes fats, 
        leaving empty spaces. The tissue is then impregnated in paraffin wax 
        which is allowed to solidify. Sections are taken from the paraffin 
        block using a microtome. These sections are very thin, approximately 
        3 to 5 microns in thickness (~ 1/250 of a millimeter in thickness). 
        The tissue section is mounted onto a glass slide and stained with 
        hematoxylin and eosin. 
        
        Plaques with atheromatous changes are termed vulnerable plaques. 
        These are unstable and prone to undergoing plaque erosion, 
        thrombosis and massive myocardial infarction. The term 
        atherosclerosis originates from the Greek word "athero" which means 
        gruel and sclerosis which means hard.

      Description: |
        This vessel demonstrates an area that has undergone plaque rupture with 
        thrombosis followed by recanalization. 
        
        There are scattered macrophages laden with hemosiderin.

        Overall, these sections show substantial occlusion but the dense fibrosis 
        with limited atheromatous change is consistent with stable plaques.
