## Software solutions for CyCIF and beyond
We develop opensource software to tackle common challenges imposed by the highly-multiplexed whole slide imaging.

### [Minerva]({{ site.baseurl }}/software/minerva)
Minerva is a suite of software tools for interpreting and interacting with complex images, organized around a guided analysis approach. The software enables fast sharing of large image data that is stored on Amazon S3 and viewed using a zoomable image viewer implemented using [OpenSeadragon](https://openseadragon.github.io/){:target="_blank"}, making it ideal for integration into multi-omic browsers for data dissemination of tissue atlases. Check out the [Minerva Wiki](https://github.com/labsyspharm/minerva-story/wiki){:target="_blank"} to learn more about the software and for news.

### ASHLAR
ASHLAR (Alignment by Simultaneous Harmonization of Layer/Adjacency Registration) is Python tool for image registration and stitching that is more rapid and accurate than existing methods in assembling subcellular-resolution, multi-channel images up to several square centimeters in size. ASHLAR uses Bioformats software to read virtually any microscope image files and write the OME-TIFF format files.

### MCMICRO
mcmicro is the end-to-end processing pipeline for multiplexed whole tissue imaging. It is comprised of stitching and registration, segmentation, and single-cell feature extration.
